    \textbf{Black Russian Terrier} is a dog breed that was created in the USSR around the late 40's and early 50's. It was mostly used for military work. I own one and her name is Fiona. You can see her here(See Figure \ref{fig:dog}).

I also like to do some \underline{math}. It's my favourite subject ever since i went to school. Here is some basic knowledge:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Pythagoras' theorem:
        \begin{math}a^2+b^2=c^2\end{math}
    

    \item Table \ref{tab:primes} shows some interesting numbers.
    \input{Tables/Stopyra_table}
\end{enumerate}

Things to do:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Git + GitHub
    \item LaTeX + Overleaf 
    \item Slack
\end{itemize}
