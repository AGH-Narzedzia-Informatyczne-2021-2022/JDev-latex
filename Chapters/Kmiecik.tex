\section{Andrzej's Chapter}

I was sat and had dinner at the restaurant there, it was an amazing experience overall. Then, I noticed \textbf{my crush was sitting next to me} and it felt really cozy. It was marvelous the way she looked at me, but all of a sudden she said: \emph{"You are going to Brazil"} -  I cried heavily, my heart was shattered and my day was ruined.

Then, I saw a \textbf{adorable} cat and it made me happier.

You can see that I possibly know some Maths: \[(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \]

But often it gets quite complicated as you can see:
$ lim_{n \to \infty} (1+ \frac{1}{a_n})^{a_n} = e $

\underline{Very important}:

The most useful list:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $1^{st}$ Example
\item $2^{nd}$ Example
\end{enumerate}

The "Master Plan":
\begin{itemize}
    \item $1^{st}$ Step
    \item $2^{nd}$ Step
\end{itemize}
Now you know we are not messing around. What has been put in the Table \ref{sqrt} is not even a fraction of our prowess.
